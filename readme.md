# Sapa.com Customer Response Prediction - End to End Machine Learning Project (To Deployment)
### Introduction
This project explores all areas of the typical life cycle of a data science project beginning with the data cleaning, EDA, feature engineering, model building and deployment.

It is a solution to the [2021 AI Bootcamp Qualification Hackathon by Data Science Nigeria](https://zindi.africa/competitions/ai-bootcamp-2021), hosted on Zindi.

### Case Study
Sapa.com is one of the leading eCommerce platforms in Nigeria with millions of daily complete transactions. The goods and services on sapa.com cater for both the elite and the masses which makes it the first choice for almost everybody in Nigeria. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic that struck the entire world in all areas of living, the companies' daily complete transactions have dropped drastically to thousands.

The CEO, Mr Echoke in his recent actions to put the platform back to the top of the eCommerce platforms chain in the country has approved the use of Artificial intelligence in User Personality Analysis. The company has contracted your team consisting of AI professionals with a special focus on recommender system development to build a robust intelligent model capable of recommending products and services to Users based on their activities on sapa.com.

#### Task::
Your team lead has assigned you to the `building of a model capable of predicting usersâ€™ responses to marketing campaigns` based on the features in the provided dataset by the sapa.com data engineer. The next phase of the project is highly dependent on the accuracy of your model as `this is the foundation of what will constitute the features of the proposed recommender system development`.

### Dataset
